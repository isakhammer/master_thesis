\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Cell membranes are the foundation of the origin of life, but are also linked to the dynamics of virus infections and genetic mutations since it controls what substances can exit or enter the cell \cite{nelson2008lehninger,hurley2010membrane}. In fact, a good understanding of the cell membrane is important for engineering proteins to manipulate various intracellular processes in living systems \cite{rojas1998genetic}.

One of the primary components of the cell membranes is lipids which serve many different functions. The lipids form a bilayer with remarkable properties such as selective flexibility, fluidity, shape optimization and its ability to fuse or divide without creating any form of leakage \cite{nelson2008lehninger}. Thus, physical processes like elastic
bending forces, fluid dynamics, temperature and diffusion are essential to how a cell membrane will evolve \cite{udo97,neidleman87}.

Generally, based on the principle of least action,\todo{Princple of leas action! Is that the correct wording?} will the dynamical system seek the minimal membrane energy configuration. For instance, let the membrane have an elastic bending energy functional, then will the cell membrane evolve towards an optimal shape for minimum mechanical energy. Another example is if there is a diffusion of a two-phase system on the membrane such that the concentrations of the two phases seek their minimal potential chemical energy. We will now describe how we could approach some of these problems mathematically.


\subsection{Elastic bending energy on evolving surfaces}%
\label{sub:willmore_flow}

Assuming that the system is a single-phase system, i.e., the lipids are uniformly distributed, can the elastic bending energy be modelled using the Canham-Helrich energy functional \cite{helfrich1973elastic, wang08, udo97}. Let us denote $b_{b},
b_{k}$ and $H_{0}$ as parameters based on physical models, then can the energy functional be denoted as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CH}
\mathcal{E} _{CH}\left( \Gamma\left( t \right)   \right) =   \int_{\Gamma  }^{}  b_{b} \left( H- H_{0} \right) ^{2} + b_{k} K
.\end{equation}
Here is $H =  \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 $ denoted as the mean curvature and $K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$ as the gaussian curvature with respectively and $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ as principal curvatures. $\Gamma \left( t
\right) = \Gamma  $ is here an evolving 2-dimensional and closed surface in $\mathbb{R} ^3$, for more info see section \ref{sec:background}.  Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, can it be shown that the problem above is equivalent to the so-called Willmore energy
functional \cite{montiel2009curves, willmore1996riemannian},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:WE}
\mathcal{E} _{W} \left( \Gamma\left( t \right)   \right) = \int_{\Gamma  }^{} \frac{1}{2} H ^2
.\end{equation}

This is a well-known problem in the mathematical community \cite{ topping2000towards, marques2014willmore,link2013gradient,kuwert2012willmore}. In fact, it is a mathematical tool used to study the geometry of surfaces because it can be used to study
the diffeomorphism from an initial surface to a minimal energy configuration, which are surfaces with the least possible surface bending for a given boundary. This is important in many areas of mathematics, including differential geometry, topology, and mathematical physics \cite{koerber2021area,jakob2022singularities, rupp21}.

It has been established many numerical methods for shape optimization problems \cite{sokolowski1992introduction,ito2008variational}, evolving surface partial differential equations (PDE) \cite{dziuk2013finite, dziuk2007finite,
binz2022convergent, barrett2007parametric, barrett2007variational, kovacs2019convergent, lehrenfeld2018stabilized} and specific
algorithms for the Willmore energy problem \eqref{eq:WE} \cite{palmurella2022parametric, dziuk2008computational, bonito2010parametric,  kovacs2021convergent, hu2022evolving}. However, the field is still in active research since many methods is not rigorously shown to be consistent.

\subsection{Two-phase separation modelling on predefined evolving surfaces }%
\label{sub:two_phase_seperation_modelling_on_surfaces_}

It also turns out that the lipids often accumulate into so-called lipid rafts, which serve as a rigid platform for proteins with special properties such as intracellular trafficking of lipids and lipid-anchored proteins \cite{ miller2020divide}. Modelling of
lipid rafts formation can be modelled as a two-phase separation problem based on minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional \cite{yushutin19},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GL}
\mathcal{E}_{GL}  \left( c   \right) = \int_{\Gamma\left(t  \right)   }^{}\Psi \left( c \right) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \left\lvert \nabla c \right\rvert^{2} ,
\end{equation}
which describes the chemical energy for a concentration $c: \Gamma\left( t \right)  \times \left[ 0,T \right] \mapsto  \left[ 0,1 \right]  $. Here is $ \Psi \left( c \right): \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ denoted as a nonlinear scalar chemical potential function. Keep in mind that unlike
the Willmore energy functional \eqref{eq:WE}, where the $\Gamma\left( t \right)  $ is determined by the elastic properties, should the energy functional \eqref{eq:GL} be interpreted as a chemical diffusion problem a predefined evolving domain $\Gamma \left( t \right) $.
Usually is this problem solved by deriving equivalent variants of partial differential equations (PDE), such as the Allen-Cahn equation (or the Cahn-Hilliard equation if the total concentration is globally conserved) on evolving domains. For further details,
see \cite{yushutin19,
 ratz16,Gera2017, caetano21, elliott2015evolving}.

\subsection{Multiphysics problems on evolving surfaces}%

Ultimately, the cell membrane will consist of interactions of several physics (temperature, elasticity, chemical diffusion, internal fluid pressure etc.)\cite{udo97}. Hence, being able to model several processes may give unforeseen results.

An interesting example is to couple the energy functionals \eqref{eq:GL}  and \eqref{eq:CH} since the lipid-rafts formation is said to change the elasticity properties of the membrane, maybe a good model for how cell membranes evolve to specific shapes or execute cell division. One way
to couple the energy functionals is to let the parameters $b_{b}, b_{k}$ and $ H_{0} $ be some function of the time dependent concentration $c$, i.e.,
\[
    \begin{split}
        \mathcal{E}_{CHGL} \left( \Gamma\left( t \right) ,c\left( t \right)    \right) =  & \int_{\Gamma  }^{}  b_{b}\left( c \right)  \left( H- H_{0}\left( c \right)  \right) ^{2}  \\
        & + \int_{\Gamma   }^{} b_{k}\left( c \right)  K \\
        &+ \int_{\Gamma   }^{}\Psi \left( c \right) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \left\lvert \nabla c \right\rvert^{2} ,
    \end{split}
\]
For more information, see \cite{elliott2010surface}.

Recently some authors also coupled diffusion processes and the so-called mean curvature energy, see \cite{burger2021interaction, elliott2022numerical}. It is well known that lipids travel
along the cell membrane in a fluidic manner, hence, it is also of interest to couple the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional \eqref{eq:GL} (or more specifically, the Cahn-Hilliard equation) with the Navier-Stokes equation. Some methods have been proposed
methods for solving the problem on surfaces
and evolving surfaces, but it remains a field of active research \cite{olshanskii2022comparison}. As far as an author knows, coupling the Canham-Helrich energy functional \eqref{eq:CH}, Ginzburg-Landau energy functional \eqref{eq:GL},  and Navier-Stokes equation remains an open problem.

Some physical processes may require constant area and volume. This can be added by introducing respective area and volume functionals, see \cite[Definition 2.5]{muller2013volume}.

Until now have all the models assumed that the membrane has no difference in internal and external pressure. As a matter of fact, osmotic pressure can be introduced by adding an energy functional using the van't Hoff formula. Let $V_{p}$ be the volume
of a closed evolving surface $\Gamma \left( t \right) $, we can then model the difference of internal and external pressure as,
\[
\Delta P \left( V_{p} \right) = P_{in} - P_{out} = iRT\left( \frac{n}{V_{p}} - \overline{c}  \right),
\]
where $i, R, T, \overline{c} $ and $n$ are the van't Hoff index, ideal gas constant, temperature, ambient molar concentration and molar amount of the enclosed solute. Then the energy
functional has the form,
\[
\mathcal{E} _{p}\left( \Gamma\left( t \right)     \right)  = \int_{\Gamma   }^{   } \Delta P\left( V_{p} \right) ,
\]
For more information, see \cite{zhu2022mem3dg}.


\subsection{Outline of this report}%
\label{sub:outline_of_this_report}

The long-term goal would be to solve the multi-physics problems above. However, many of the problems presented are fairly complicated to solve numerically and require sophisticated techniques. Hence, in this report, we focus on the latest research within
the numerical optimizations methods of finding the minima of the energy functional \eqref{eq:WE}.

First of all, we will establish notation by including a section for definitions and important results from differential geometry and shape derivatives. We will then derive the
underlying dynamical system of evolutionary system dynamics using the gradient flow technique inspired by shape optimization methods based on the work done in \cite{ dougan2012first}. Lastly, we will establish the numerical methods of the system
dynamics by applying recent methods using an evolutionary surface finite element method (FEM) \cite{kovacs2021convergent, hu2022evolving}.
