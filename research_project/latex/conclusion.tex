\section{Conclusion}

We have presented several interesting multiphysics processes to consider when modelling cell membrane dynamics. First, we introduced an elastic bending energy on evolving surfaces using the Canham-Helrich energy functional \eqref{eq:CH} and the equivalent Willmore energy functional. Secondly, we established that the diffusion of a two-phase system can be modelled using the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional \eqref{eq:GL} and discussed how we could combine the energy functional models to do multiphysics problems. 

To demonstrate the techniques used to solve physical problems on evolving domains, we chose the Willmore energy functional \eqref{eq:WE}. The background theory of calculus on surfaces and evolutionary dynamics was briefly discussed and then applied to define the strong and weak (or integral) formulation of the system dynamics. We then established a basic numerical framework and introduced the evolution surface finite element method.
