 - Membrane inertia.
   Equation (5) implies that the fluid and the
membrane are always in local equilibrium. This means that
the inertia of the membrane itself is neglected (otherwise an
additional acceleration term would appear [78, 111, 112]). 


- Lipid Rafts. Specialized regions in membranes of highly packed and ordered lipids, more rigid than the rest of the membrane since it is consisting of cholestoerol to glue then together and remained intact when they did experiments to solubilize the membrane. They can move in the membrane and form larger rafts or brake down to smaller ones!  Proteins with special properties are linked to this rafts, signaling proteins (GPCR, RTK), True resident proteins (Caveolin, GPI anchored proteins, Flotillin) and cytoskeletal proteins/adhesion molecules (Integrins, Cadherin). 

Type I Lipid raft: Full of Caveolin endocytocis. Type II Lipids rafts Enriched with Flotillin (very much in neurocells). 
 
- Membrane fluidity:
Lipids are fatty acid phospholipids ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43385748/201779259-d7201ba9-5e7a-4e5d-864f-a3e2b67ddbe5.png) High temps tends to increase fluidity since the tension between lipids are smaller. 

Cholesterol is at low temp increasing the distance between the lipids, which is as well increasing the lipid fluidity. And at high temperature does decrease the distane of the lipids which is reducing the fluidity. Hence, cholestorol is a buffer when temperature is increasing. 

The lipid tails can be saturated or unsaturated. If the lipids are saturated, then the tails of the lipids are straight and nice with no fancy bondings, hence the fluidity is decreasing. With unsaturated lipids they tends to have more distance which is increasing the fluidity.

- Types of proteins on the membrane:
   Integral Proteins: Is inside the membrane and do alot of processes.
       Ion channels Na+. No Energy needed/ATP. Will reduce the consentration gradient of Na+
       Ion cannons/Carrier protein: Energy needed/ATP. Can go against the concentration gradient.
       Glyco proteins: Sugar proteins and signalling. 
   Peripheral proteins: Sticks on the outside of the proteins. Can be a hormone which does it things and leave
   Lipid bound: protein that is stuck in the interior of the membrane (not too functional)

- Fluid mosaic model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mosaic_model
Discovered in 1972: SJ Singer and GL Nicolson proposed the fluid mosaic model as an explanation for the data and latest evidence regarding the structure and thermodynamics of cell membranes.[2]



# Lipid Raft formation
- Controversy of lipid rafts formation and the existence.
- Conservation law of lipid rafts: Cahn Hilliard. Lipid rafts that join into bigger sections
- Nonconservation law of lipid rafts: Allen Cahn. May be justified if phase seperation induces high curvature that leads to vesicle budding (transport of something interior of the cell). Question. How does phase seperation leads to higher curvature? mhmhmhm

-  => This paper is not considering bending and elastic energy and navier stokes!! ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43385748/201790896-93928884-3959-460f-9533-4829e4b324b0.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43385748/201791054-f3f6be97-c7f7-4ac1-b4bb-1891dcd41324.png)
- Both Cahn hilliard and Allehn-Cahn has Lyaponov stability. nice!
