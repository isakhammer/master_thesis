  abstract = {Two fully discrete, discontinuous Galerkin schemes with time-dynamic, locally refined meshes in space are developed for a fourth-order Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation with an added nonlinear reaction term, a phenomenological model that can describe cancerous tumour growth. The proposed schemes, which are both second-order in time, are based on a primitive-variable discontinuous Galerkin spatial formulation that is valid in any number of space dimensions. We prove that the schemes are convergent, with optimal-order error bounds, even in the case where the mesh is changing with time, provided that the number of mesh changes is bounded by some constant. The schemes represent flexible, high-order accurate alternatives to the standard mixed C0 finite element methods and nonconforming (plate) finite element methods for solving fourth-order parabolic partial differential equations. We conclude the paper with tests showing the convergence of the scheme at the predicted rates and the flexibility of the method for approximating complex solution dynamics efficiently.},

  abstract = {The paper is concerned with boundary singularities of weak solutions of boundary value problems governed by the biharmonic operator. The presence of angular corner points or points at which the type of boundary condition changes in general causes local singularities in the solution. For that case the general theory of V. A. Kondrat'ev provides a priori estimates in weighted Sobolev norms and asymptotic singular representations for the solution which essentially depend on the zeros of certain transcendental functions. The distribution of these zeros will be analysed in detail for the biharmonic operator under several boundary conditions. This leads to sharp a priori estimates in weighted Sobolev norms where the weight function is characterized by the inner angle of the boundary corner. Such estimates for ``negative'' Sobolev norms are used to analyse also weakly nonlinear perturbations of the biharmonic operator as, for instance, the von K\'arm\'an model in plate bending theory and the stream function formulation of the steady state Navier-Stokes problem. It turns out that here the structure of the corner singularities is essentially the same as in the corresponding linear problem.},

In this paper, we present a three-field mixed finite-element formulation for fourth-order problems, with a focus on the effective treatment of the different boundary conditions that arise naturally in a variational formulation. Our formulation is based on introducing the gradient of the solution as an explicit variable, constrained using a Lagrange multiplier. The essential boundary conditions are enforced weakly, using Nitsche's method where required. As a result, the problem is rewritten as a saddle-point system, requiring analysis of the resulting finite-element discretization and the construction of optimal linear solvers. Here, we discuss the analysis of the well-posedness and accuracy of the finite-element formulation. Moreover, we develop monolithic multigrid solvers for the resulting linear systems. Two and three-dimensional numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the discretization and efficiency of the multigrid solvers proposed.},

Finite element solutions are not common because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are only well defined and integrable if the finite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally C1-continuous. There are a very limited number of two-dimensional finite elements possessing C1-continuity applicable to complex geometries, but none in three-dimensions. We propose isogeometric analysis as a technology that possesses a unique combination of attributes for complex problems involving higher-order differential operators, namely, higher-order accuracy, robustness, two- and three-dimensional geometric flexibility, compact support, and, most importantly, the possibility of C1 and higher-order continuity. A NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation was tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state solutions in two-dimensions and, for the first time, in three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping method is introduced. We also present a technique for desensitizing calculations to dependence on mesh refinement. This enables the calculation of topologically correct solutions on coarse meshes, opening the way to practical engineering applications of phase-field methodology.},

For these schemes and other second-order schemes previously introduced in the literature, we study the constraints on the physical and discrete parameters that can appear to assure the energy-stability, unique solvability and, in the case of nonlinear schemes, the convergence of Newton's method to the nonlinear schemes. Moreover, in order to save computational cost we have developed a new adaptive time-stepping algorithm based on the numerical dissipation introduced in the discrete energy law in each time step. Finally, we compare the behaviour of the schemes and the effectiveness of the adaptive time-stepping algorithm through several computational experiments.},

  abstract = {Herein, we present a numerical convergence study of the Cahn\textendash Hilliard phase-field model within an isogeometric finite element analysis framework. Using a manufactured solution, a mixed formulation of the Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation and the direct discretisation of the weak form, which requires a C1-continuous approximation, are compared in terms of convergence rates. For approximations that are higher than second-order in space, the direct discretisation is found to be superior. Suboptimal convergence rates occur when splines of order p=2 are used. This is validated with a priori error estimates for linear problems. The convergence analysis is completed with an investigation of the temporal discretisation. Second-order accuracy is found for the generalised-{$\alpha$} method. This ensures the functionality of an adaptive time stepping scheme which is required for the efficient numerical solution of the Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation. The isogeometric finite element framework is eventually validated by two numerical examples of spinodal decomposition.},

  abstract = {Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.},

Within membranes, lipid phase separation can alter local composition, dynamics, and allosteric regulation of membrane proteins. The interplay between lipid\textendash lipid, lipid\textendash protein and protein\textendash protein interactions gives flexibility to membrane lateral organization. In this review we examine how lipid phase separation impacts lateral transport of lipids and proteins within membranes. First, we discuss the role of liquid\textendash liquid coexistence in the organization of model biomembranes, and how such demixing can redistribute lipids and proteins into different regions. Next, the role of curvature in membrane patterning via its influence on lipid composition and protein spatial distribution in both model and biological systems is examined. Then, we discuss how critical fluctuations can organize membrane proteins. Finally, we review how external forces can be used to control the organization of lipids and proteins within biomembranes; with examples covering how ATP driven protein adsorption, electrophoresis, and hydrodynamic flow can transport and redistribute lipids and proteins laterally within membranes.},

  abstract = {Intracellular bodies such as nucleoli, Cajal bodies and various signalling assemblies represent membraneless organelles, or condensates, that form via liquid\textendash liquid phase separation (LLPS)1,2. Biomolecular interactions\textemdash particularly homotypic interactions mediated by self-associating intrinsically disordered protein regions\textemdash are thought to underlie the thermodynamic driving forces for LLPS, forming condensates that can facilitate the assembly and processing of biochemically active complexes, such as ribosomal subunits within the nucleolus. Simplified model systems3\textendash 6 have led to the concept that a single fixed saturation concentration is a defining feature of endogenous LLPS7\textendash 9, and has been suggested as a mechanism for intracellular concentration buffering2,7,8,10. However, the assumption of a fixed saturation concentration remains largely untested within living cells, in which the richly multicomponent nature of condensates could complicate this simple picture. Here we show that heterotypic multicomponent interactions dominate endogenous LLPS, and give rise to nucleoli and other condensates that do not exhibit a fixed saturation concentration. As the concentration of individual components is varied, their partition coefficients change in a manner that can be used to determine the thermodynamic free energies that underlie LLPS. We find that heterotypic interactions among protein and RNA components stabilize various archetypal intracellular condensates\textemdash including the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, stress granules and P-bodies\textemdash implying that the composition of condensates is finely tuned by the thermodynamics of the underlying biomolecular interaction network. In the context of RNA-processing condensates such as the nucleolus, this manifests in the selective exclusion of fully~assembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, providing a thermodynamic basis for vectorial ribosomal RNA flux out of the nucleolus. This methodology is conceptually straightforward and readily implemented, and can be broadly used to extract thermodynamic parameters from microscopy images. These approaches pave the way for a deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of multicomponent intracellular phase behaviour and its interplay with the nonequilibrium activity that is characteristic of endogenous condensates.},

Recent studies have elucidated many aspects of the molecular interactions underlying the formation of these remarkable and ubiquitous droplets and the way in which such interactions dictate their material properties, composition, and phase behavior.

  abstract = {We present the software design of Gridap, a novel finite element library written exclusively in the Julia programming language, which is being used by several research groups world-wide to simulate complex physical phenomena such as magnetohydrodynamics, photonics, weather modeling, non-linear solid mechanics, and fluid-structure interaction problems. The library provides a feature-rich set of discretization techniques for the numerical approximation of a wide range of mathematical models governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), including linear, nonlinear, single-field, and multi-field equations. An expressive API allows users to define PDEs in weak form by a syntax close to the mathematical notation. While this is also available in previous frameworks, the main novelty of Gridap is that it implements this API without introducing a domain-specific language plus a compiler of variational forms. Instead, it leverages the Julia just-in-time compiler to build efficient code, specialized for the concrete problem at hand. As a result, there is no need to use different languages for the computational back-end and the user front-end anymore, thus eliminating the so-called two-language problem. Gridap also provides a low-level API that is modular and extensible via the multiple-dispatch paradigm of Julia and provides easy access to the main building blocks of the library if required. The main contribution of this paper is the detailed presentation of the novel software abstractions behind the Gridap design that leverages the new software possibilities provided by the Julia language. The second main contribution of the article is a performance comparison against FEniCS. We measure CPU times needed to assemble discrete systems of linear equations for different problem types and show that the performance of Gridap is comparable to FEniCS, demonstrating that the new software design does not compromise performance.

These systems are driven by external energy input, for example provided by an external fuel reservoir. The external energy input gives rise to novel phenomena that are not present in passive systems. For instance, concentration gradients can spatially organise emulsions and cause novel droplet size distributions. Another example are active droplets that are subject to chemical reactions such that their nucleation and size can be controlled, and they can divide spontaneously. In this review, we discuss the physics of phase separation and emulsions and show how the concepts that govern such phenomena can be extended to capture the physics of active emulsions. This physics is relevant to the spatial organisation of the biochemistry in living cells, for the development of novel applications in chemical engineering and models for the origin of life.},

The variational formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, its implementation and numerical examples are presented. In this communication, it is also shown under what conditions the method is stable, and an error estimate in an energy-type norm is presented.

Only elementary tangential calculus and the embedding of the surface in R3 are used to formulate the model, thereby facilitating the development of a fully Eulerian discretization method to solve the problem numerically. A hybrid method, finite difference in time and trace finite element in space, is introduced and stability of its semi-discrete version is proved. The method avoids any triangulation of the surface and uses a surface-independent background mesh to discretize the equation. Thus, the method is capable of solving the Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation numerically on implicitly defined surfaces and surfaces undergoing strong deformations and topological transitions. We assess the approach on a set of test problems and apply it to model spinodal decomposition and pattern formation on colliding surfaces.
