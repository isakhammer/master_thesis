\subsection{Introduction to numerical methods for Cahn Hilliard}%
\label{sub:introduction_to_numerical_methods_for_cahn_hilliard}

The first Cahn-Hilliard paper appeared when computing evolving free energy of two-component incompressible fluids  and, thus, have been crucial in the theory of irreversible thermodynamics.\cite{cahn1958free, cahn1959free, falk1992cahn}
Cahn Hilliard appears in a lot of applications such as in image inpainting, chemical engineering and biology \cite{bressloff2014stochastic} thus, and comes in many forms \cite{miranville2017cahn}.
Mixed CutFEM formulation of Cahn-Hilliard \cite{karatzas2021reduced} and a mixed Hybrid High-Order method \cite{chave2016hybrid}. Isogeometric formulation of Cahn-Hilliard \cite{kastner2016isogeometric, gomez2008isogeometric} and unfitted versions \cite{zhao2017variational}. Isogeoemtric formulation on moving
surfaces \cite{zimmermann2019isogeometric}. Virtual $C^{1}$  elements has also been considered \cite{antonietti2016c}.

CIP formulation of the Cahn-Hilliard was presented in \cite{wells2006discontinuous} which avoids high derivatives along boundaries, thus no need for global $C^{1}$ elements.


\subsection{ODE integrators}%
\label{sub:ode_integrators}
\todo[inline]{ Write about explicit and implicit integrators,numerically dissipative, accuracy and conditionally/unconditionally stability }

      Introduced unconditionally stable, second order accurate, numerically dissipative with parameters $\alpha$ and $ \beta $,  Newmans Method \cite{newmark1959method}
    Improved versions of the Newmark method by introducing the numerically dissipative parameters such as the Hilber method and the Bossak Method \cite{hilber1977improved, wood1980alpha}. Combing these ideas the Generalized $\alpha $ method from which all the other methods can be derived \cite{chung1993time}.
