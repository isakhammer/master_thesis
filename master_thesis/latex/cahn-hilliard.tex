\section{Cahn Hilliard equation }%
\label{sec:cahn_hilliard_equation}

Explain the full discretization scheme including

\begin{itemize}
    \item CutFEMCIP for spatial discretization
    \item implicit Euler for temporal discretization
    \item linearization of nonlinearity (IMEX)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction to numerical methods for Cahn Hilliard}%
\label{sub:introduction_to_numerical_methods_for_cahn_hilliard}

Present numerical results for CH in separate chapter including
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your numerical EOC for  manufactured solution for \textbf{linear} 4th order parabolic
    \item Your numerical EOC for  manufactured solution for \textbf{full} C-H
    \item Nice numerical example in 2d (flower)
    \item Nice numerical example in 3d (popcorn/doughnut geometries)
\end{itemize}
