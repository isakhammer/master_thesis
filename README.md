### Solving the Biharmonic Equation using a Continuous Interior Penalty Finite Element Method

I did my specialization project at Norwegian University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Andr√© Massing.

The goal of the thesis was to
- State the issues that arise when solving the biharmonic equation
- Derive the continuous penalty method method based on the work done by Gu`s [PhD Dissertation](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/1744/)
- Derive stability and apriori estimates.
- Verify the estimates numerically.

The thesis should be digestible for graduate students with basic knowledge within finite element methods and numerical analysis.

### Mathematical modelling of cell membranes 
**Abstract:** This article aims to show novel methods of mathematical modelling of biological cell membranes. We first presented general research on incorporating multi-physics into mathematical models. We then presented a mathematical and numerical shape optimization framework using a gradient flow method and a finite element method to solve cell membrane dynamics specifically for the elastic bending energy on evolving surfaces.
